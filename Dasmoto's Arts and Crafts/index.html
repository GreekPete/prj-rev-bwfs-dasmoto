<!-- I believe there are two ways of including the background image. what about
if <div class="header">
  <img src="" alt="name" />
  <h1>Dasmort Arts and crafts</h1>
</div> and then use the code in css of .header img and .header h1. I tried to do it
that way in the beginning but i couldnt figure out the margins of the page.
Can you please comment and elaborate on this please? -->
